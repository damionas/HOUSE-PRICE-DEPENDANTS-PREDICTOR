# HOUSE-PRICE-DEPENDANTS-PREDICTOR


    Estimating the sale prices of houses and the imoact on the various independent variables on the house price
  
  
Various types of linear regression algorithm where use for the model development.
      Linear regression was used as it is an algorithm used to predict values that are continuous in nature
      
      
To predict the sale prices i used the following linear regression algorithms: Ordinal Least Square (OLS) algorithm, Ridge regression algorithm, Lasso regression algorithm.These algorithms can be feasibly implemented in python with the use of the scikit-learn package.


Finally, i concluded which model is best suitable for the given case by evaluating each of them using the evaluation metrics provided by the scikit-learn package. R square
